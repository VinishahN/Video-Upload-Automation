# Project Neo - Video Upload Automation
This is a Python script which when run, helps in uploading a video to all the social media platforms - Youtube, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter - all at once!



## Workflow
- Once the python script is run, the user will have to specify some details which are essential to upload videos. 

- The user will have to provide the title, description, category_id and the access type for uploading to Youtube and a caption for Twitter! 

- The script then shows a list of video files from a local directory from which the video to be uploaded can be chosen. 

- After the required video file has been chosen to upload, if the file chosen is of mp4 media type, then uploading functionalities begin to execute. Else the video file is converted into mp4 format and then uploading functionalities begin to execute.
